            <h2>1. Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>To provide the United States with a standing, uniformed, non-combat medical capability that ensures national health readiness, stabilizes the healthcare workforce, and provides a guaranteed baseline of clinical care as a public utility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. The Problem: Systemic Fragility</h2>
            <p>The U.S. healthcare system is currently a "just-in-time" market-based model that fails during crises and leaves geographic "deserts."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Workforce:</strong> $300k+ medical debt drives clinicians into high-billing specialties, leaving a massive deficit in primary and rural care.</li>
                <li><strong>Readiness:</strong> No standing "surge" capacity exists for pandemics or disasters; the system operates at 95% capacity daily.</li>
                <li><strong>Economics:</strong> Administrative overhead (billing/insurance friction) consumes 25% of every healthcare dollar.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. The Solution: The Uniformed Service Model</h2>
            <p>The USMF is established as the eighth Uniformed Service of the United States.</p>

            <h3>The Education Pipeline</h3>
            <p>The <strong>USMF Academy</strong> and <strong>Medical ROTC</strong>. The government pays 100% of tuition/stipend. In exchange, graduates serve 5 years in the USMF. This creates a debt-free, mission-driven workforce.</p>

            <h3>The Clinical Corps</h3>
            <p>A standing force of doctors, nurses, and medics deployed to federally-run <strong>USMF Community Clinics</strong>. These clinics provide "Tier 1" care (Primary, Urgent, Mental Health, Vaccinations) to all citizens with zero billing friction.</p>

            <h3>The Reserve Component</h3>
            <p>A "Medical Reserve" of private-sector clinicians who train monthly and can be "activated" for national emergencies, providing instant surge capacity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Market Integration (The "Public Utility" Dynamics)</h2>
            <p>The USMF does not compete with the private market; it <strong>anchors</strong> it.</p>

            <h3>The Base Load</h3>
            <p>USMF handles the "commodity care" that is low-profit for private systems but essential for public health.</p>

            <h3>De-Risking Insurers</h3>
            <p>By providing the baseline, USMF removes high-risk/low-margin populations from private insurance pools. Insurers pivot to high-margin supplemental, elective, and disability products.</p>

            <h3>Price Stabilization</h3>
            <p>USMF's transparent, federal-scale procurement of drugs and equipment sets a national "floor" for prices, preventing monopoly-driven spikes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Governance and Oversight</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Command:</strong> Led by a 4-star General/Admiral (The Surgeon General of the Medical Force).</li>
                <li><strong>Oversight:</strong> Joint oversight by HHS (clinical standards) and DoD (logistics/readiness).</li>
                <li><strong>Ethics:</strong> Strict firewalls between medical data and law enforcement/immigration.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The United States Medical Force represents a structural solution to a structural problem. By treating healthcare capacity as national security infrastructure, we create a system that is resilient, equitable, and economically sustainable.</p>
            <p>This is not "socialized medicine." This is <strong>public infrastructure enabling private value creation</strong>—just as federal highways enable commerce and the military enables security.</p>
