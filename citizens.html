        <h2>What USMF Means for You</h2>

        <div class="promise">
            <strong>The National Guarantee:</strong> Every American would have access to baseline medical care—primary care, urgent care, mental health services, vaccinations, and chronic disease management—through the United States Medical Force, regardless of income or insurance status.
        </div>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>USMF would establish a network of <strong>Community Medical Clinics</strong> staffed by uniformed doctors, nurses, and medics who chose service over debt. These clinics would provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Care:</strong> Annual checkups, sick visits, chronic disease management</li>
            <li><strong>Urgent Care:</strong> Treatment for injuries and acute illnesses</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Counseling and psychiatric care</li>
            <li><strong>Preventive Care:</strong> Vaccinations, screenings, health education</li>
            <li><strong>Maternal & Child Health:</strong> Prenatal care, pediatrics, family planning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>No Bills. No Forms. No Denials.</h2>
        <p>When you walk into a USMF clinic, you receive care. There are no co-pays, no pre-authorizations, and no surprise bills for baseline services. The care is funded federally, just like the fire department or the military.</p>

        <h2>What About Private Insurance?</h2>
        <p>USMF does not replace private insurance. If you want:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access to specific private specialists</li>
            <li>Elective procedures</li>
            <li>Premium hospital accommodations</li>
            <li>Income protection if you become ill</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...you can still purchase private insurance. USMF simply ensures that <strong>no one goes without basic care</strong>.</p>

        <h2>For Rural and Underserved Communities</h2>
        <p>USMF would prioritize deployment to areas where hospitals have closed or where there are no doctors. Mobile medical units and telehealth would extend the reach of the Force to every zip code.</p>

        <h2>Want to Serve?</h2>
        <p>If you're interested in becoming a doctor, nurse, or medic, USMF would offer a <strong>debt-free path</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The government pays for your education</li>
            <li>You serve 5 years in the Medical Force</li>
            <li>You graduate with <strong>zero debt</strong> and real-world experience</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="promise">
            <strong>The Vision:</strong> Healthcare becomes a public good—like roads, schools, and national defense. It's there when you need it, funded by all of us, for all of us.
